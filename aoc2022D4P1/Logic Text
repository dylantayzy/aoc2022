I read line by line
My approach is to split all the numbers into individual strings using .substr()
Then stoi the numbers to get them as integers.
Label them as lower and upper bounds of pair 1 and pair 2
Then compare the lowerbounds and the upperbounds to find ranges which one pair contain the other
Furthermore, if the first comparison passes, I reset by setting the value of the lower and upperbounds so that it won't pass the second comparison or else I double count.

This code was more brute force style.
I force the entire input in a long string of 10000 characters.
A X C Y (repeated with other letters)
I exploit the periodic nature of the string but using indexes 0, 2, 4, 6... to count the number of 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' and add it to the xcount, ycount and zcount
Then I use indexes 0, 4, 8, 12... to process each match individually to get the score out
Using multiple "if" statements to compute the score manually

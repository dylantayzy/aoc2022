In summary, this solution is called the "Brute Force" method
Basically, I first type in all the stacks of boxes into vectors with character types (stack1, stack2...)
Then I get the first line, stoi to get the number of boxes to move, which stack to move from (which I will call oriStack) and which stack to move the boxes to (newStack)
Then I push back the last element of the oriStack to the newStack and remove the last element from the oriStack using pop_back()
Iterate through every line using case by case scenario (by making many ifs statements to find which stack I need to look at)
After the iteration have finished, I push back the last element of each stack into a vector called answer
Output the elements of answer and that's the... answer.

For part 2, I took a different approach
I setted the stacks to be of strings, not of a vector because I needed to move multiple letters at once
I substring the number of letters to move
Then I added strings
Repeat the process for each line till I get the final answer

I read the input line by line
Within each line is a string
And the string splits in the middle to form the order of each rucksack
So I make two strings, 1 for rucksack 1 and 1 for rucksack 2
I iterate through the string to find the common letter between each of them
Once a common letter is found, I push the repeated letter into a vector, then empty both strings and go to the next rucksack pair
After all inputs are processed and all repeats are found, I iterate through the vector containing the repeated letters.
For each element of the vector, I find the vector within the vector of alphabets I created (a, b, c ...)
I get the index from the vector of alphabets and use that index to locate the number associated with that letter using another vector of numbers (1, 2, 3...)
Making sure that the indexes of the number vector correspond to the index of the letter that is associated with that value.
Finally, output a sum.
